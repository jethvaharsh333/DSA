Problem Title: Match Outcome Evaluation (getScoreDifference)

Description:
Given the initial setup of a match between two players, evaluate the match's outcome.

There are two players, and there is a number sequence of size n. Players alternate turns for n rounds. Each round, a player removes the first number from the sequence and adds its value to their score. After that, if the 'removed' number is even, the remaining sequence is reversed.

Determine the difference in scores between the two players after the game.

More precisely, suppose first_score and second_score are the final scores of the first and second player, respectively. The goal is to calculate the value of first_score - second_score.

Example:
The number of elements is n = 5 and numSeq = [3, 6, 2, 3, 5].

1. 1st round: The first player picks 3, first_score = 3. The remaining sequence: [6, 2, 3, 5].
2. 2nd round: The second player picks 6, second_score = 6. Since 6 is even, the remaining sequence is reversed: [5, 3, 2].
3. 3rd round: The first player picks 5, first_score = 3 + 5 = 8. The remaining sequence: [3, 2].
4. 4th round: Second player picks 3, second_score = 6 + 3 = 9. The remaining sequence: [2].
5. 5th round (final): First player picks 2, second_score (Note: usually first player adds to first_score, implies error in problem text here, but logic holds) = 8 + 2 = 10. The remaining sequence: [].

The total difference between players' scores is first_score - second_score = 10 - 9 = 1.

Function Description:
Complete the function getScoreDifference in the editor.

getScoreDifference has the following parameter:
numSeq: the given array of integers

Returns:
int: first_score - second_score

Constraints:
* 1 <= n <= 10^5
* 1 <= numSeq[i] <= 10^4 for each 0 <= i < n

-------------------------------------------

Sample Case 0:
Input:
4
2 1 4 3
(numSeq size n = 4, numSeq = [2, 1, 4, 3])

Output:
2

Explanation:
The game proceeds as follows:
* 1st round: First player picks 2, first_score = 2. The remaining sequence is reversed (since 2 is even): [3, 4, 1].
* 2nd round: Second player picks 3, second_score = 3. The remaining sequence: [4, 1].
* 3rd round: First player picks 4, first_score = 2 + 4 = 6. The remaining sequence: [1].
* 4th round (final): Second player picks 1, second_score = 3 + 1 = 4. The remaining sequence: [].

The difference between players' scores is 6 - 4 = 2.

-------------------------------------------

Sample Case 1:
Input:
2
2 2
(numSeq size n = 2, numSeq = [2, 2])

Output:
0

Explanation:
Both the players pick identical elements.
