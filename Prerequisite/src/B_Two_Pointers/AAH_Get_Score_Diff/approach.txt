Understanding :-> P1 and P2 are two players; in each player’s turn they will select the first element of the current array -> remove that element from the array -> add it to their sum;
-> If the latest removed element is even then we need to reverse the remaining before next player plays the game on array

-> Find score(P1) - score(P2)

-> Brute Force :- O(N*N);

-> Optimization :-> Two Pointer -> https://www.jdoodle.com/ia/1Iwi

TC :- O(N)

-> Takes O(1) size space;
