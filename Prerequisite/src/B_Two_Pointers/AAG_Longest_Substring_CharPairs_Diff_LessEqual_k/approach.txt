-> A substring is only valid if max char [i……i] and min char [i…..j]
-> max - min <=k

-> Find the largest substring such that max char - min  char <= k -> follows monotonous nature.

-> Exactly same as find the largest subarray whose sum <= k

-> if max - min <=k -> j++
-> max - min > k -> i++

*** DEQUE SOLUTION IS THE MOST OPTIMAL HERE.
