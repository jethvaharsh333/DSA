Problem statement [https://www.codingninjas.com/studio/problems/superior-elements_6783446?utm_source=striver&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=a_zcoursetuf&leftPanelTabValue=PROBLEM]
There is an integer array ‘a’ of size ‘n’.
An element is called a Superior Element if it is greater than all the elements present to its right.
You must return an array all Superior Elements in the array ‘a’.

Note:The last element of the array is always a Superior Element. 

Example

Input: a = [1, 2, 3, 2], n = 4
Output: 2 3
Explanation: 
a[ 2 ] = 3 is greater than a[ 3 ]. Hence it is a Superior Element. 
a[ 3 ] = 2 is the last element. Hence it is a Superior Element.
The final answer is in sorted order.

Sample Input 1:
4 
1 2 2 1
Sample Output 1:
1 2
Explanation of Sample Input 1:
Element present at the last index is '1' and is a superior element since there are no integers to the right of it.
Element present at index 2 (0-indexed) is '2' and is greater than all the elements to the right of it.
There are no other superior elements present in the array.
Hence the final answer is [1,2].

Sample Input 2:
3
5 4 3
Sample Output 2:
3 4 5 

Expected Time Complexity:
Try to solve this in O(n).

Constraints:
1 <= n <=10^5 
1 <= a[i] <= 10^9
Time Limit: 1 sec
