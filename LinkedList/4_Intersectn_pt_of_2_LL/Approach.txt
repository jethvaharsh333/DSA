1] Brute force
First we traverse both linked list and store each element in stack.
Now popping  elements from both stack and if not equal then return last popped element else if equal then continue popping.

2] 
-First we will get length of both linked list.
-Now if ll1 > ll2 then forward ll1 pointer
else forward ll2 pointer
-At this point both linked list's length will be same and compare ll element
if false then forward both ll1 and ll2 pointer
else return ll1 or ll2 pointer
