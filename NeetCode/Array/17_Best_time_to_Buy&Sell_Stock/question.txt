121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock [https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/description/]

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

Example 1:
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

Example 2:
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
 
Constraints:
1 <= prices.length <= 105
0 <= prices[i] <= 104

Problem statement [https://www.codingninjas.com/studio/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock_6194560?utm_source=striver&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=a_zcoursetuf&leftPanelTabValue=PROBLEM]
You are given an array of integers 'prices' of size 'n', where ‘prices[i]’ is the price of a given stock on an ‘i’-th day.
You want to maximize the profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and a different day to sell that stock.
Please note that you can’t sell a stock before you buy one.
Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction.

Example :
Input: ‘prices’ =[7, 1, 5, 4, 3, 6]
Output: 5
Explanation: Purchase stock on day two, where the price is one, and sell it on day six, where the price is 6, profit = 6 - 1 = 5.
Hence we return 5.

Sample Input 1:
6
7 1 5 4 3 6
Sample Output 1 :
5
Explanation Of Sample Input 1:
Purchase stock on day two, where the price is one, and sell it on day six, where the price is 6. Profit = 6 - 1 = 5.

Sample Input 2:
5
5 4 3 2 1
Sample Output 2 :
0

Expected time complexity :
The expected time complexity is O(n).

Constraints :
1 <= 'n' <= 10 ^ 5
1 <= ‘prices[i]’<= 10 ^ 9

Time Limit: 1 sec
