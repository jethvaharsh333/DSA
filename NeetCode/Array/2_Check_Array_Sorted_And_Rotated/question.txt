CODING NINJAS
Problem statement:
You have been given an array ‘a’ of ‘n’ non-negative integers.You have to check whether the given array is sorted in the non-decreasing order or not.
Your task is to return 1 if the given array is sorted. Else, return 0.

Example :
Input: ‘n’ = 5, ‘a’ = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: 1
The given array is sorted in non-decreasing order; hence the answer will be 1.

1752. Check if Array Is Sorted and Rotated && https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-array-is-sorted-and-rotated/
Problem statement:
Given an array nums, return true if the array was originally sorted in non-decreasing order, then rotated some number of positions (including zero). Otherwise, return false.
There may be duplicates in the original array.

Note: An array A rotated by x positions results in an array B of the same length such that A[i] == B[(i+x) % A.length], where % is the modulo operation.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: true
Explanation: [1,2,3,4,5] is the original sorted array.
You can rotate the array by x = 3 positions to begin on the the element of value 3: [3,4,5,1,2].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,1,3,4]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no sorted array once rotated that can make nums.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: true
Explanation: [1,2,3] is the original sorted array.
You can rotate the array by x = 0 positions (i.e. no rotation) to make nums.

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 100
1 <= nums[i] <= 100
