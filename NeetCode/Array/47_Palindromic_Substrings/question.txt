647. Palindromic Substrings [MEDIUM][https://leetcode.com/problems/palindromic-substrings/description/]

Given a string s, return the number of palindromic substrings in it.
A string is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

Example 1:
Input: s = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c".
Example 2:
Input: s = "aaa"
Output: 6
Explanation: Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".
3: "baba" = 6 = b,a,b,a,bab,aba
4: "babab" = 9 = b,a,b, a,b,bab, aba,bab,babab
5: "aaabb" = 9

Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 1000
s consists of lowercase English letters.
