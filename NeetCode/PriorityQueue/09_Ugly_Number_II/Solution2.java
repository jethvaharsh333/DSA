Example: n=8
Letâ€™s walk through the process for n=8:

Start with heap = [1] and seen = {1}.
Extract 1, generate 2, 3, 5, add them:

heap = [2, 3, 5], seen = {1, 2, 3, 5}.
Extract 2, generate 4, 6, 10, add them:

heap = [3, 5, 4, 6, 10], seen = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10}.
Extract 3, generate 6, 9, 15, add them:

heap = [4, 5, 10, 6, 9, 15], seen = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15}.
Extract 4, generate 8, 12, 20, add them:

heap = [5, 6, 8, 15, 9, 10, 12, 20], seen = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 20}.
Extract 5, generate 10, 15, 25, add them:

heap = [6, 9, 8, 15, 20, 10, 12, 25], seen = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 20, 25}.
Extract 6, generate 12, 18, 30, add them:

heap = [8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 12, 18, 30], seen = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 25, 30}.
Extract 8: Stop (this is the 8th ugly number).

Final result: 8.
