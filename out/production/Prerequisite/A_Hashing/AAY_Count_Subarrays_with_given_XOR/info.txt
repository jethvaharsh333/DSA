https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/count-number-subarrays-given-xor/

Given an array of integers arr[] and a number k, the task is to count the number of subarrays having XOR
of their elements as k.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [4, 2, 2, 6, 4], k = 6
Output: 4
Explanation: The subarrays having XOR of their elements as 6 are [4, 2], [4, 2, 2, 6, 4], [2, 2, 6], and [6].

Input: arr[] = [5, 6, 7, 8, 9], k = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The subarrays having XOR of their elements as 5 are [5] and [5, 6, 7, 8, 9].
