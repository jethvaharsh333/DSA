3728. Stable Subarrays With Equal Boundary and Interior Sum
https://leetcode.com/problems/stable-subarrays-with-equal-boundary-and-interior-sum/description/

You are given an integer array capacity.

A subarray capacity[l....r] is considered stable if:
Its length is at least 3.
The first and last elements are each equal to the sum of all elements strictly between them
(i.e., capacity[l] = capacity[r] = capacity[l + 1] + capacity[l + 2] + ... + capacity[r - 1]).

Return an integer denoting the number of stable subarrays.

Example 1:
Input: capacity = [9,3,3,3,9]
Output: 2
Explanation:
[9,3,3,3,9] is stable because the first and last elements are both 9, and the sum of the elements strictly between them is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9.
[3,3,3] is stable because the first and last elements are both 3, and the sum of the elements strictly between them is 3.

Example 2:
Input: capacity = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 0
Explanation:
No subarray of length at least 3 has equal first and last elements, so the answer is 0.

Example 3:
Input: capacity = [-4,4,0,0,-8,-4]
Output: 1
Explanation:
[-4,4,0,0,-8,-4] is stable because the first and last elements are both -4, and the sum of the elements strictly between them is 4 + 0 + 0 + (-8) = -4

Constraints:
3 <= capacity.length <= 105
-109 <= capacity[i] <= 109
