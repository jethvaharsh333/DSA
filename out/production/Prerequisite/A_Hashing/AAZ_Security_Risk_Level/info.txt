Code Question 1 - Security Risk Level

Amazon is launching a revolutionary security feature that incorporates an advanced antivirus program,
adept at identifying and halting potential threats.

This framework manages n active programs, each with a unique Program Identifier (PID).
The antivirus program evaluates the overall security risk of the system using a specialized algorithm.

Problem Description:
    The algorithm works as follows:
    - It analyzes all contiguous subarrays of the array pid.
    - For each subarray:
      - Compute the sum of the PIDs.
      - Compute the remainder when this sum is divided by a constant k.
    - If the remainder equals the number of elements in that subarray, the subarray is considered malicious.
    - The overall security risk is defined as the total number of malicious subarrays.

Given:
    - An array pid of size n, representing the PIDs of the programs running on the computer.
    - An integer k with which the remainder is checked.

Notes
    - Remainder is defined as the remaining part after performing division.
        Example: the remainder of 13 divided by 5 is 3.
    - A subarray is a contiguous portion of an array.
        For example, in the array [5, 7, 9, 11], possible subarrays include [5,7], [7,9,11], [11], etc.

A subarray maintains the original order of elements and consists of consecutive elements.

Example
    n = 4
    pid = [1, 3, 2, 4]
    k = 4
Explanation
    There are 2 malicious contiguous subarrays:
    1. Subarray [0, 0] → [1]
       - Sum = 1
       - 1 % 4 = 1
       - Length = 1
       - ✅ Malicious (1 = 1)
    2. Subarray [2, 3] → [2, 4]
       - Sum = 6
       - 6 % 4 = 2
       - Length = 2
       - ✅ Malicious (2 = 2)

    Non-malicious example:
    - Subarray `[3, 2]`
      - Sum = 5
      - 5 % 4 = 1
      - Length = 2
      - ❌ Not malicious (1 != 2)

    Output
    2
