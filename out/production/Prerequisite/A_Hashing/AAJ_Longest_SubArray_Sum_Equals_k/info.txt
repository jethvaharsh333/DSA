Problem: Largest Subarray with Sum = K

TEST CASE 1: Basic Positive Numbers
Input:
n = 5
arr = 1 2 3 1 1
k = 5
Expected Output:
Largest subarray with sum 5 is from index 1 to 3
Explanation:
2 + 3 = 5
3 + 1 + 1 = 5 (largest subarray)

TEST CASE 2: Whole Array Matches

Input:
n = 4
arr = 2 1 1 1
k = 5

Expected Output:
Largest subarray with sum 5 is from index 0 to 3

TEST CASE 3: No Subarray Exists

Input:
n = 4
arr = 1 2 3 4
k = 20

Expected Output:
No subarray with sum 20

TEST CASE 4: Contains Negative Numbers

Input:
n = 6
arr = 1 -1 5 -2 3
k = 3

Expected Output:
Largest subarray with sum 3 is from index 0 to 3

Explanation:
1 + (-1) + 5 + (-2) = 3

TEST CASE 5: Single Element Equals K

Input:
n = 5
arr = 4 2 7 1 3
k = 7

Expected Output:
Largest subarray with sum 7 is from index 2 to 2

TEST CASE 6: Multiple Valid Subarrays (Choose Largest)

Input:
n = 7
arr = 3 4 -7 1 3 3 1
k = 7

Expected Output:
Largest subarray with sum 7 is from index 0 to 5

Explanation:
3 + 4 = 7
1 + 3 + 3 = 7
3 + 4 - 7 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 7 (largest)

TEST CASE 7: All Zeros

Input:
n = 5
arr = 0 0 0 0 0
k = 0

Expected Output:
Largest subarray with sum 0 is from index 0 to 4

TEST CASE 8: Single Element Array

Input:
n = 1
arr = 5
k = 5

Expected Output:
Largest subarray with sum 5 is from index 0 to 0

TEST CASE 9: Negative K

Input:
n = 5
arr = -1 -2 -3 -4 -5
k = -9

Expected Output:
Largest subarray with sum -9 is from index 1 to 3

Explanation:
-2 + -3 + -4 = -9

TEST CASE 10: Empty Array (Edge Case)

Input:
n = 0
arr = (empty)
k = 5

Expected Output:
No subarray with sum 5
